## About Project/Code Source
Most of the code came from other assignments/work we did in the class. I tried to work with documentation where I could but a lot of the specific cases in this project were in other class assignments we already did. I also used my notes, I have a lot of notes for this section as I predicted this stuff would need to be pretty similar across projects.
